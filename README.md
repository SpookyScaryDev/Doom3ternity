# Doom3ternity
Doom 3ternity is a mod for Doom 3 which incorporates gameplay elements from Doom 1, 2 2016 and Eternal into Doom 3

**THIS MOD IS IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT READY TO BE PLAYED**

This is my first Doom 3 mod, and I am creating it to learn about modding and the Doom 3 engine. When this mod is in a releasable state, I will update this README.

### Features:
* Weapons can be centered using "doom3ternity_front_and_center"

* Sped up shotgun firerate
* Decreased shotgun spread and damage
* Stopped burnaway
* Lowered gibing threshold - controllable with "doom3ternity_gib_health"
* Added dashing and removed stamina for sprinting using _impulse41. Max dashes can be controlled with "doom3ternity_max_dashes", dash speed can be controlled with
 "doom3ternity_dash_speed" and dash regen speed can be controlled with "pm_staminarate"
* Added super shotgun
* Add meathook to super shotgun using _impulse42. Speed can be controled using "doom3ternity_grapple_speed"
