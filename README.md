# Doom3ternity
Doom 3ternity is a mod for Doom 3 which incorporates gameplay elements from Doom 1, 2 2016 and Eternal into Doom 3

**THIS MOD IS IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT READY TO BE PLAYED**

This is my first Doom 3 mod, and I am creating it to learn about modding and the Doom 3 engine. When this mod is in a releasable state, I will update this README.
