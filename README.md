# Doom3ternity
Doom 3ternity is a mod for Doom 3 which incorporates gameplay elements from Doom 1, 2 2016 and Eternal into Doom 3

**THIS MOD IS IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT READY TO BE PLAYED**

This is my first Doom 3 mod, and I am creating it to learn about modding and the Doom 3 engine. When this mod is in a releasable state, I will update this README.

### Features:
* Weapons can be centered using "doom3ternity_front_and_center"
* Air jumps controlled by "doom3ternity_max_air_jumps"
* Increased player movement speed
* Increased jump height
* Sped up weapon switching
* Removed reloading
* Sped up shotgun firerate
* Decreased shotgun spread and damage
* Stopped burnaway
* Lowered gibing threshold - controllable with "doom3ternity_gib_health"

### In Progress:
* Add dashing / tweak sprinting

### Planned:
* Add weapon inspection
